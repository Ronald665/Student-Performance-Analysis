# **Student Mathematics Performance Analysis Report**

## **1. Introduction**

This report presents the results of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) carried out to understand the factors influencing students’ 
performance in mathematics. The dataset comprises 1,000 students with attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation status.
The goal is to uncover performance patterns, identify key demographic or socio-economic influences, and recommend strategies for improving academic outcomes.

## **2. Population Overview**

* **Male students:** 482
* **Female students:** 518
* **Gender ratio:** Approximately **1:1**

## **3. General Performance in Mathematics**

* **Average (Mean):** 66.1
* **Median:** 66
* **75th Percentile:** 77

**Insights:**
Overall student performance in mathematics centers around the mid-60s, indicating that while the general competency level is satisfactory, there is room for improvement.
Most students scored within the **60–79** range, reflecting a moderate level of proficiency across the population.

**Recommendation:**
Schools should strengthen academic reinforcement programs such as after-school tutoring, peer-assisted learning, and early performance monitoring to support students
near or below the national average.

## **4. Gender-Based Performance**

| Gender | Mean | Median | 75th Percentile |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| Male   | 68.7 | 66     | 79              |
| Female | 63.6 | 66     | 74              |

**Findings:**

* Male students performed better overall, with higher mean and 75th percentile scores.
* The median score for both genders remained the same, suggesting similar central tendencies but higher variability among males.

**Interpretation:**
The results suggest possible differences in learning confidence, interest in mathematics, or classroom engagement between genders.

**Strategic Recommendation:**

* Encourage female participation in STEM related programs through mentorship, math clubs, and motivational workshops.
* Incorporate genderresponsive teaching techniques to boost engagement and confidence among female students.

## **5. Ethnic/Racial Group Performance**

| Ethnic Group | Mean | Median | 75th Percentile |
| ------------ | ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| Group A      | 61.6 | 61     | 71              |
| Group B      | 63.4 | 63     | 74              |
| Group C      | 64.5 | 65     | 74              |
| Group D      | 67.4 | 69     | 77              |
| Group E      | 73.8 | 74.5   | 85              |

**Observations:**

* **Group E** students recorded the highest performance, followed by **Group D**.
* Groups A–C lagged behind the national average of 66.
* Male students in Group E had the highest median score (78), outperforming all other subgroups.

**Interpretation:**
Cultural or environmental factors may play a role in these disparities. Students from Groups D and E likely benefit from strong academic motivation, supportive family structures, or access to better educational resources.

**Strategy:**

* Conduct focus group discussions with high performing groups to identify successful study habits and environmental factors.
* Develop targeted academic support for underperforming groups through mentorship and resource access.

## **6. Impact of Test Preparation**

| Test Preparation | Mean | Median |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Completed        | 70   | 69     |
| None             | 64.1 | 64     |

**Findings:**

* Students who completed a test preparation course scored significantly higher.
* Male students benefited slightly more (mean increased from 66.7 → 72.3) compared to females (61.7 → 67.2).

**Interpretation:**
This demonstrates the strong positive impact of **structured test preparation** on student performance and confidence.

**Recommendations:**

* Expand access to **test preparation programs**, especially for lower-income or underperforming students.
* Implement **digital and peer-led preparatory platforms** for flexible learning.
* Encourage schools to **integrate mock assessments** into their teaching schedules.

## **7. Effect of Lunch Type (Socio-Economic Indicator)**

| Lunch Type   | Mean | Median |
| ------------ | ---- | ------ |
| Standard     | 70.0 | 69     |
| Free/Reduced | 58.9 | 60     |

**Insights:**
Students with a **standard lunch plan** outperformed those on **free/reduced lunches**, suggesting a connection between nutrition and academic success. The performance gap was more pronounced among male students.

**Interpretation:**
This emphasizes the influence of socio-economic factors on educational outcomes. Poor nutrition may limit concentration and learning retention.

**Recommendations:**

* Collaborate with **nutrition-focused programs** to provide balanced meals for low-income students.
* Schools can introduce **meal subsidies or sponsorship schemes** to minimize inequality.

## **8. Parental Education Level**

| Education Level    | Mean | Median |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------ |
| High School        | 62.1 | 63     |
| Some High School   | 63.5 | 65     |
| Some College       | 67.1 | 67.5   |
| Associate’s Degree | 67.9 | 67     |
| Bachelor’s Degree  | 69.4 | 68     |
| Master’s Degree    | 69.7 | 73     |

**Findings:**
